### ≡ƒ¢á∩╕Å GitHub Actions

- ≡ƒæ╖ [ci] Disable Codecov max_report_age to prevent CI timing issues
 - Update codecov.yml: set codecov.max_report_age to off (was "24h")
 - Rationale: avoid rejecting valid coverage uploads due to CI delays, clock skew, or slow runners
 - No other Codecov settings changed; uploads and notification behavior preserved
