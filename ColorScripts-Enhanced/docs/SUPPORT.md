## What We Ask of You

- Review the [Documentation index](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/ps-color-scripts-enhanced#documentation) before filing a new issue.
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide as much context as possible (operating system, PowerShell version, terminal, reproduction steps, and logs if relevant).
- Be respectful—our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/ps-color-scripts-enhanced/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all support interactions.

## Out-of-Scope Requests

Maintainers may not be able to provide support for:

- Custom ANSI art generation that is unrelated to the module
- Terminal emulator configuration outside of Nerd Font setup guidelines
- Issues caused by third-party forks or modified distributions
- Deprecated PowerShell versions (earlier than 5.1) or unsupported platforms

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Please **do not** open public issues for potential vulnerabilities. Instead, follow the [Security Policy](https://github.com/Nick2bad4u/ps-color-scripts-enhanced/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to reach the maintainer privately.

## Commercial Support

Commercial support is not currently offered. If your organization requires custom terms or SLAs, open an issue to discuss options.
