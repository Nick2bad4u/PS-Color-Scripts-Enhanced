- 🧹 [chore] Remove legacy caching system

Removes the legacy caching system and integrates caching directly into the module.

- 🚀 **Motivation**: The old caching system relied on a separate `ColorScriptCache.ps1` file included in each script. This approach was redundant and less efficient than module-managed caching.
- ✅ **Benefits**:
 - Simplifies script structure by removing cache check headers.
 - Improves performance by centralizing caching logic within the module.
 - Reduces the module's footprint by removing `ColorScriptCache.ps1`.
- 🛠️ **Details**:
 - Removes the `ColorScriptCache.ps1` file.
 - Removes cache check lines from all scripts in the `Scripts/` directory. 🚫
 - Modifies `Get-ColorScriptMetadataTable` and `Get-ColorScriptEntry` to no longer exclude `ColorScriptCache.ps1`.
 - Updates `Build-ColorScriptCache` and `Clear-ColorScriptCache` to accept pipeline input. 🌊
 - Updates tests and documentation to reflect the changes. 🧪 📝

- ✨ [feat] Enhance script selection with wildcards

This commit introduces wildcard support for script names across multiple commands, enhancing flexibility and ease of use.

- 🌟 Implements wildcard matching for script names in `Show-ColorScript`, `Get-ColorScriptList`, `Build-ColorScriptCache`, and `Clear-ColorScriptCache`.
 - This allows users to specify patterns like `aurora-*` to target multiple scripts at once.
- 🏠 Adds tilde (`~`) expansion for profile paths in `Add-ColorScriptProfile`, allowing users to specify paths relative to their home directory.
- ⚠️ Introduces warnings for unmatched patterns in `Show-ColorScript` and `Get-ColorScriptList`, informing users when a specified script name or pattern is not found.
- 🐛 Fixes a potential issue in `Invoke-LintPass` where ScriptAnalyzer might fail with custom settings; retries without settings in such cases.
- 🧪 Adds new tests to validate wildcard functionality and tilde expansion.
- 📝 Updates documentation to reflect the new wildcard support and tilde expansion.
