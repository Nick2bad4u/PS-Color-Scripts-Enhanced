  "description": "> **Credits:** This project owes its existence to the foundational work of two incredible developers. The beautiful ANSI art scripts were originally created by Derek Taylor (DistroTube) in his project [shell-color-scripts](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts). The collection was then thoughtfully ported to PowerShell by Scott McKendry as [ps-color-scripts](https://github.com/scottmckendry/ps-color-scripts). `ColorScripts-Enhanced` builds upon their efforts by introducing a high-performance caching system, PowerShell Cross-Platform support on Linux and Mac, an expanded command set, and a formal module structure, but the creative core remains their legacy. Thank you, Derek and Scott, for your contributions!",
